This is a project I made as part of my university course COSC428 in the university of canterbury.


The program identify people and then using information from a depth camera calculates the distance to a person, then it
predicts the person and there parts using a kalman filter and if they will be within 3 meters of the camera in 3 seconds.

To run this program simply run the main.py file.
